      the healthcare needs of the community.
    </p>

      Why Register as a Blood Donor?
    </h2>

    <div className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed space-y-4">
      <p>
        Blood cannot be manufactured in a laboratory. It can only come from generous individuals who are willing to donate. A single blood donation can help multiple patients through the separation of blood into different components such as red blood cells, platelets, and plasma.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you complete your Voluntary Blood Donor Registration, you join a community committed to ensuring that safe blood is available whenever patients need it. Regular blood donation helps maintain adequate blood stocks and supports hospitals in providing timely treatment during emergencies.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every donation contributes to improving healthcare outcomes and gives hope to patients and families during difficult times. Your willingness to donate blood can make a meaningful difference in someone’s life.
